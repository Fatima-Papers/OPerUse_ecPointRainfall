# OperUse_ecPointRainfall
A new statistical post-processing technique (ecPoint), applied to raw forecast model output, delivers rainfall forecasts for points across the world. Verification shows that marked improvements are achieved, for extremes also, which encourages widespread utilisation for warning issue. However, the post-processed forecasts add layers of complexity to traditional probabilistic forecasts which could render interpretation difficult for users. So, a collaborative pilot study with the national hydro-meteorological services of Costa Rica and Hungary was conducted to assess the extent to which the products would be correctly used, and fully exploited, in operational forecasting environments with different climatological characteristics. The key component regarding interpretation was the guidelines written for users. This study found that whilst correct utilisation of the new products was indeed challenging, by adopting an approach that fully caters for different levels of experience with probabilistic forecasts this could be achieved, and indeed decision-making in critical situations could be improved. This is encouraging for the wider adoption of this new forecast product and we use the findings to provide new guidelines which should cover a wide range of settings, including forecasting environments in which the product usage background is primarily deterministic.
