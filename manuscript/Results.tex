\caption{Forecast evolution (from day 7 to day 1) for the rainfall event occurred between October 4th at 12am and October 5th at 0am (see Fig.\ref{Obs_CaseStudy_CR}d to compare the forecasts with the observations). From the left, the first column shows the 85th percentile for ecPoint-Rainfall (as used operationally by IMN), the second column shows the 85th percentile for the raw ENS, the third column shows the 99th percentile for ecPoint-Rainfall, the fourth column shows the wettest member of the raw ENS, and the fifth column shows the deterministic forecast from WRF-1.5 (spatial resolution of 1.5 km) typically used by IMN in the forecasts of extreme localized rainfall events. The shown raw ECMWF ENS and ecPoint-Rainfall forecasts correspond to runs at 12 UTC, which is the first available run from Europe to IMN forecasters due to time difference between Europe and America (UTC-6). The displayed WRF-1.5 forecasts correspond to runs at 18 UTC, which is the first run available to IMN forecasters in the morning for their in-house models. The colour scheme of the second column plots have been modified, compared to the original IMN products (see Fig.\ref{ecPoint_Product_CR}d), to standardize all the plots in this figure, and make easier the forecasts comparison between models.}
